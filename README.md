# tools
Collection of random scripts and tools that I have written for one reason or another.
------------------
### aspx_vb_linker.py
A small script to take large collections of aspx files written in vb and spit out a single file.
Written for projects that use the include directives that iis uses. While a handy feature of iis, 
my text editor had no idea what to do with them. This meant that navigating the project was tedious.
